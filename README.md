# HSDJointReassigner
A quick commandline .dat editor to re-assign objects underneath different bones, ignoring vertex weight assignment - powered by Ploaj's HSDLib.
Drag a .dat onto the .exe, make changes, and type "done". It will generate a new file with the desired changes and the suffix "_edited"
